## Git and Github

- Git is a software and Github is a service.
- Git is a version control system. It is : popular, free & Open source, fast & scalable.
- Github - It is website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.
- Clone = cloining a repository on our local machine -- git clone <-some link ->
- Status = displays the state of the code -- git status
- cd = change directory
- Untracked = new file that git doesn't yet track
- modified = changed in file
- staged - file is ready to be continued
- unmodified - unchanged
- add -> commit
- add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
  git add <-flle name ->
  git add . = commit all
- commit - it is record of change
  git commit -m "some message"
- push - upload local repo content to remote repo
  git push origin main

### Software development
- Software Engineering is a systematic approach to analyze, design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software using defined processes and models.
1. Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/SDLC_-_Software_Development_Life_Cycle.jpg
   SDLC Phases
  1. Requirement Analysis
  2. Design
  3. Implementation (coding)
  4. Testing
  5. Deployment
  6. Maintainence

| Feature     | Function-Oriented | Object-Oriented |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Focus       | Functions         | Objects         |
| Data        | Separate          | Encapsulated    |
| Reusability | Low               | High            |
| Examples    | C                 | Java, C++       |

- Modularity = dividing system into modules
- Cohesion = How closely related elements in a module (High cohesion = good)
- Coupling = Dependency between modules (Low coupling = good)
- Layering = Organizing system into layers (UI, Service, Database)

### Software Process Models
- A Software Process Model defines the order (sequence) of activities involved in software development such as requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
- Types of process models
  1. Waterfall model <br>
     A linear and sequential model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.<br>
     Phases = Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance <br>
     Advantages = Simple and easy to understand, Well-defined stages, Good for small projects <br>
     Disadvantages = No flexibility, Difficult to change requirements, Late testing <br>
     Best suited for : Small projects with fixed requirements <br> 
  2. Incremental model <br>
     Software is developed and delivered in small increments (parts).
  3. Iterative Model <br>
     Development starts with a simple version and improves through repeated cycles (iterations).
  4. Sprial Model <br>
     A risk-driven model combining waterfall and iterative approaches. <br>
     key features : risk analysis in every loop <br>
  5. Agile Model <br>
     A flexible and iterative model focusing on customer collaboration and rapid delivery. <br>
     Agile divides work into sprints<br>
     Key Principles : Customer involvement, Small iterations (sprints), Working software over documentation. <br>
     Projects with frequently changing requirements. <br>
     Agile development gives importance to working software.

| Model       | Key Feature            | Best For              |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Waterfall   | Sequential             | Fixed requirements    |
| Incremental | Part-by-part delivery  | Large systems         |
| Iterative   | Repeated cycles        | Evolving requirements |
| Spiral      | Risk analysis          | High-risk projects    |
| Agile       | Customer collaboration | Changing requirements |

##### One-Line Exam Answers<br>
- Waterfall Model: Linear sequential model
- Incremental Model: Software delivered in parts
- Iterative Model: Developed through repeated cycles
- Spiral Model: Risk-driven development model
- Agile Model: Flexible, customer-centric model

### Software Product
- A Software Product is the final outcome of the software development process. <br>
Software Product = Software + Documents + Data <br>
- Two types of software Product<br>
1. Generic <br>
2. Customized <br>

| Feature      | Generic Product | Customized Product |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Users        | Many users      | Single client      |
| Requirements | General         | Client-specific    |
| Cost         | Lower per user  | Higher             |
| Flexibility  | Limited         | High               |
| Example      | Browser         | Bank software      |

### UML
- UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standard visual modeling language used to visualize, design, document, and communicate the structure and behavior of software systems—especially object-oriented systems.
- Why UML is Used (Importance) 
Provides a common language for developers and stakeholders <br>
Helps understand system requirements clearly <br>
Reduces design errors before coding <br>
Improves documentation and maintenance <br>


## Agile Methodology
- Agile is a simple and ingenous concept through continuous incremental improvement through small and frequent releases.
- Large project divide into small tasks.
