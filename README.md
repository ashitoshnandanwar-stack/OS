## Git and Github

- Git is a software and Github is a service.
- Git is a version control system. It is : popular, free & Open source, fast & scalable.
- Github - It is website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git.
- Clone = cloining a repository on our local machine -- git clone <-some link ->
- Status = displays the state of the code -- git status
- cd = change directory
- Untracked = new file that git doesn't yet track
- modified = changed in file
- staged - file is ready to be continued
- unmodified - unchanged
- add -> commit
- add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
  git add <-flle name ->
  git add . = commit all
- commit - it is record of change
  git commit -m "some message"
- push - upload local repo content to remote repo
  git push origin main

### Software development
- Software Engineering is a systematic approach to analyze, design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software using defined processes and models.
1. Software development lifecycle (SDLC)
   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/SDLC_-_Software_Development_Life_Cycle.jpg
   SDLC Phases
  1. Requirement Analysis
  2. Design
  3. Implementation (coding)
  4. Testing
  5. Deployment
  6. Maintainence

| Feature     | Function-Oriented | Object-Oriented |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Focus       | Functions         | Objects         |
| Data        | Separate          | Encapsulated    |
| Reusability | Low               | High            |
| Examples    | C                 | Java, C++       |

- Modularity = dividing system into modules
- Cohesion = How closely related elements in a module (High cohesion = good)
- Coupling = Dependency between modules (Low coupling = good)
- Layering = Organizing system into layers (UI, Service, Database)

### Software Process Models
- A Software Process Model defines the order (sequence) of activities involved in software development such as requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
- Types of process models
  1. Waterfall model
     A linear and sequential model where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
     Phases = Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance
     Advantages = Simple and easy to understand, Well-defined stages, Good for small projects
     Disadvantages = No flexibility, Difficult to change requirements, Late testing
     Best suited for : Small projects with fixed requirements
  2. Incremental model
