| Feature              | Operating System                    | Application Software         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Purpose              | Manages hardware & system resources | Performs user-specific tasks |
| Dependency           | Works directly with hardware        | Runs on OS                   |
| Execution            | Starts when computer boots          | Starts after OS loads        |
| Hardware Interaction | Direct interaction                  | No direct interaction        |
| Example              | Windows, Linux                      | MS Word, Browser, Photoshop  |
| Mandatory            | Yes (system cannot run without it)  | No (optional)                |

- OS is hardware dependent because it directly controls and communicates with hardware using device drivers and CPU instructions.
- OS acts as interface between user and hardware.
- OS is also known as Resource Manager.
- Kernel → heart of OS, always in memory, communicates with CPU, memory, and devices, Responsibility resource allocation
- Device drivers → hardware control
- OS = system software + resource manager
- Hardware dependent → OS, Drivers
- Interface between OS and user -> shell
- Memory managed by OS - both primary and secondary
- Multiple programs in memory - multiprogramming

## Different component of OS

1. kernel
```
Definition
The kernel is the central and most important component of the OS. It directly interacts with hardware.
🔹 Functions
Process management
Memory management
Device management
Interrupt handling
Resource allocation
```

2.Process Manaagement
```
🔹 Functions
CPU scheduling is a function of process management
Context switching
Process states (New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated)
Deadlock handling
```

3.Memory Management
```
Manages primary (RAM) and secondary memory (disk).
🔹 Functions
Allocation & deallocation
Paging & segmentation
Virtual memory
Protection of memory space
```

4.File System Management
```
Manages files and directories on storage devices.
🔹 Functions
File creation, deletion
Directory management
Access permissions
File naming and protection
```

5.Device Management
```
Controls and coordinates I/O devices.
🔹 Key Element
Device drivers
🔹 Functions
I/O scheduling
Buffering
Spooling
Interrupt handling
```

6.I/O Management
```
Handles input and output operations efficiently.
🔹 Functions
Buffering
Caching
Spooling
Interrupt-based I/O
```

7.Security & Protection
```
Prevents unauthorized access to system resources.
🔹 Includes
User authentication
Authorization
Access control
Protection mechanisms
```

8.Shell (User Interface)
```
Shell is the interface between user and kernel.
🔹 Types
CLI (Command Line Interface)
GUI (Graphical User Interface)
```

9.ystem Utilities (Supporting Programs)
```
🔹 Examples
Disk cleanup
Antivirus
Backup tools
🔹 Purpose
Assist in system maintenance (not core OS).
```

| Component          | Main Function       |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Kernel             | Resource management |
| Process Management | CPU scheduling      |
| Memory Management  | RAM & disk handling |
| File System        | Files & directories |
| Device Management  | Hardware control    |
| I/O Management     | Input/output        |
| Security           | Protection          |
| Shell              | User interface      |

- Spooling means temporarily storing data in a buffer or intermediate storage area before it's processed or sent to its final destination.

## What is an Interrupt?
```
An interrupt is a signal that temporarily stops the CPU to handle an urgent event.

🔹 Types of Interrupts
Hardware interrupt – keyboard, mouse, I/O device
Software interrupt – generated by programs
Timer interrupt – for CPU scheduling

📌 MCQ Line:
👉 Interrupts are handled by the kernel.

🔹 Why Interrupts are Needed?
Efficient CPU utilization
Multitasking
Quick response to I/O events
```

## System Call
```
What is a System Call?
A system call is a mechanism by which a user program requests services from the OS kernel.

🔹 Examples
read()
write()
open()
fork()

📌 MCQ Line:
👉 System calls provide an interface between user programs and OS.

🔹 Why System Calls are Needed?
User programs cannot directly access hardware
Ensures controlled and secure access

```

| Feature     | Interrupt                 | System Call        |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Trigger     | Hardware / software event | User program       |
| Nature      | Asynchronous              | Synchronous        |
| Purpose     | Handle urgent events      | Request OS service |
| Mode switch | Yes                       | Yes                |
