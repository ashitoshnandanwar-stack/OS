- OS is hardware dependent because it directly controls and communicates with hardware using device drivers and CPU instructions.
- OS acts as interface between user and hardware.
- OS is also known as Resource Manager.
- Kernel → heart of OS, always in memory, communicates with CPU, memory, and devices, Responsibility resource allocation
- Device drivers → hardware control
- OS = system software + resource manager
- Hardware dependent → OS, Drivers
- Interface between OS and user -> shell
- Memory managed by OS - both primary and secondary
- Multiple programs in memory - multiprogramming

- Spooling means temporarily storing data in a buffer or intermediate storage area before it's processed or sent to its final destination.

## What is an Interrupt?
```
An interrupt is a signal that temporarily stops the CPU to handle an urgent event.

🔹 Types of Interrupts
Hardware interrupt – keyboard, mouse, I/O device
Software interrupt – generated by programs
Timer interrupt – for CPU scheduling

📌 MCQ Line:
👉 Interrupts are handled by the kernel.

🔹 Why Interrupts are Needed?
Efficient CPU utilization
Multitasking
Quick response to I/O events
```

## System Call
```
What is a System Call?
A system call is a mechanism by which a user program requests services from the OS kernel.

🔹 Examples
read()
write()
open()
fork()

📌 MCQ Line:
👉 System calls provide an interface between user programs and OS.

🔹 Why System Calls are Needed?
User programs cannot directly access hardware
Ensures controlled and secure access

```

| Feature     | Interrupt                 | System Call        |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Trigger     | Hardware / software event | User program       |

```
🔹 Key Features
Open source
Portable (runs on many hardware platforms)
Multiuser & multitasking
Secure and stable
CLI (Command Line Interface) based (also GUI available)
```

## 🔁 Operators in Linux

1️⃣ Redirection Operators
- Redirection is used to redirect input/output.

| Operator | Meaning                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `>`      | Output redirection (overwrite) |
| `>>`     | Output redirection (append)    |
| `<`      | Input redirection              |

```
ls > files.txt        # overwrite output
ls >> files.txt       # append output
sort < data.txt       # input redirection
```

2️⃣ Pipe Operator (|)
- The pipe operator sends output of one command as input to another.
- command1 | command2
```
ls | wc -l        # count files
ps -ef | grep root
```

## 🔐 File Permissions in Linux
- File permissions define who can read, write, or execute a file/directory.

```
👥 Permission Classes
User (u) – file owner
Group (g) – group members
Others (o) – everyone else

🔑 Permission Types
r (read) = 4
w (write) = 2
x (execute) = 1

- rwx r-x r--
  rwx → user (give all permission) - 7
  r-x → group (read and execute permission) - 5
  r-- → others (only read permission) - 4

```

| 7      | rwx        |
| 6      | rw-        |
| 5      | r-x        |
| 4      | r--        |

## 👤 Changing Ownership – chown & chgrp

```
chown user file.txt
chown user:group file.txt

chgrp group file.txt
```

## ACL (Access Control List) 
- it is basically a list of rules that says who can do what with a file, folder, or system resource.
- ACL provides fine-grained permissions beyond user/group/others.

| Command | Purpose       | Security   |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| telnet  | Remote login  |  Insecure  |
| ftp     | File transfer |  Insecure  |

| finger  | User info     |    –       |

## 🧩 System (Shell) Variables in Linux
- System variables (shell variables) control the behavior and appearance of the shell. They are widely used in Bash.

| Variable | Purpose                 |
| -------- | --------------------    |
| PS1      | Primary shell prompt (/)|
| PS2      | Continuation prompt (>) |
| PS3      | Select loop prompt      |
| PS4      | Debug prompt            |

## 🐚 Shell Programming – Introduction

Command execution
Script execution
Variable handling
Input/output redirection
Process control
```
